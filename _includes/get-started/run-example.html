<h1>Run the examples</h1>

<div class="blue uppercase">This guide covers, Downloading the Kogito examples, Building and running one of the Kogito examples, and Testing the running example with some REST requests.</div>

<h2>Download Kogito examples</h2>

<p>To download a released version of the Kogito examples, visit <a href="https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/releases" target="_blank">this page</a> and select the latest version of the kogito-examples. Simply unzip it. It contains various out-of-the-box examples.  We will be focusing on the jbpm-quarkus-example here.</p>

<h3>Building and running jbpm-quarkus-example</h3>
<p>The jbpm-quarkus-example shows how you can build your own order service by leveraging a business process to describe the logic that the service should follow.  The example includes a simple process that describes the steps that need to be followed when ordering items: a sequence of a script task (which is writing out some debug info) and a call activity invoking a sub-process, using a custom <code>Order</code> data element.</p>

<p>The sub-process invokes a custom Java service <code>CalculationService.calculateTotal</code>, followed by a user task to verify the order.</p>

<p>Based on these two processes (defined using BPMN 2.0 format), the custom data object and the custom Java service mentioned earlier, the example shows how a new service is generated that exposes REST operations to create new orders (following the steps as defined in the main and sub-process), or to list and delete active orders. You can choose to create this service based on either Quarkus or SpringBoot.</p>
