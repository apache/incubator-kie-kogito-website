<h2>Building and running a rule example</h2>
<p>Our rule example shows how you can build your own rule service. The example includes simple rules that validate, update and query <code>LoanApplication</code> facts.</p>

<p>REST endpoints are generated from query rules. You can insert <code>LoanApplication</code> facts and query a result via the REST endpoints. Rule resources are assembled as a RuleUnit.</p>

<p>Loan applications are evaluated by rules based on the amount of loan and deposit. REST endpoints return approved loan applications or any information by queries.</p>

<p>You can choose to create this service based on either <a href="https://quarkus.io" target="_blank">Quarkus</a> or <a href="https://spring.io/projects/spring-boot" target="_blank">Spring Boot</a> (select appropriate tab below).  If you don't have any preference, we recommend you get started with Quarkus since it is a Kubernetes native Java stack (supporting GraalVM) with a lot of capabilities (like hot-reload in dev mode) that we can leverage.</p>
