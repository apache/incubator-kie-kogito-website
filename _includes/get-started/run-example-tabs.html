    <h2>Quarkus</h2>

    <p>Open your command line and go into the jbpm-quarkus-example folder.  First we will build the service.  Based on the process definitions, this will generate the necessary code to turn this into a domain-specific order service with REST endpoints to start, list and remove orders.<br/><br/>For local development, you have 3 options to build and start the service:
      <ul>
        <li>Since the service runs on top of Quarkus, you can take advantage of the development capabilities that Quarkus offers (like live reload etc.), and run the service in Quarkus development mode.</li>
        <li>You can also run the service as a regular Java service.</li>
        <li>You can take advantage of native image compilation (requires GraalVM), which will further optimize and minimize the service using native image compilation.</li>
      </ul>
      Please pick one of the options (A, B or C) below.
    </p>
    <h3>A. Build and run in development mode</h3>
    <pre><code>mvn clean package quarkus:dev</code></pre>
    <p>Your service should be up and running, you can test your service now as described below.

    <h3>B. Build and run in JVM mode</h3>

    <pre><code>mvn clean package 
java -jar target/jbpm-quarkus-example-{version}-runner.jar</code></pre>
or on Windows
    <pre><code>mvn clean package
java -jar target\jbpm-quarkus-example-{version}-runner.jar</code></pre>
    <p>Your service should be up and running, you can test your service now as described below.

    <h3>C. Build and run in native mode (requires GraalVM)</h3>
    <pre><code>mvn clean package -Pnative
./target/jbpm-quarkus-example-{version}-runner</code></pre>
    <div class="orange">Note: This does not yet work on Windows, GraalVM and Quarkus should be rolling out support for Windows soon.</div>
    <p>Your service should be up and running, you can test your service now as described below.  When running in development mode, Swagger UI can be used to look at or even test the exposed REST endpoints by navigating to <a href="http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui">http://localhost:8080/swagger-ui</a>.</p>

    <h2>Spring Boot</h2>

    <p>Open your command line and go into the jbpm-springboot-example folder. First we will build the service.  Based on the process definitions, this will generate the necessary code to turn this into domain-specific order service with REST endpoints to start, list and remove orders.<br/><br/>For local development, you have 2 options to build and start the service:
      <ul>
        <li>Since the service runs on top of Spring Boot, you can take advantage of the development capabilities that Spring Boot offers and run the service using the Spring Boot maven plugin.</li>
        <li>You can also run the service as a regular Java service.</li>
      </ul>
      Please pick one of the options (A or B) below.
    </p>

    <h3>A. Build and run in development mode</h3>
    <pre><code>mvn clean package spring-boot:run</code></pre>
    <p>Your service should be up and running, you can test your service now as described below.

    <h3>B. Build and run in JVM mode</h3>
    <pre><code>mvn clean package 
java -jar target/jbpm-springboot-example-{version}.jar</code></pre>
or on Windows
    <pre><code>mvn clean package
