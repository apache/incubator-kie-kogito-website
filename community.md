## Getting help

If you have any questions, make sure to take a look at the [Kogito documentation](https://docs.jboss.org/kogito/release/latest/html_single/). 

### Examples

Kogito can be used in many ways, so to help you get started, we provide a wide range of examples demonstrating from simple hello world to more advanced use cases
using DMN, BPMN, KNative, Serverless Workflow and more. Head to [Kogito examples](https://github.com/kiegroup/kogito-examples/) repository in GitHub and start exploring.
The team is constantly updating this repository with new and exciting features as they are added to Kogito.
