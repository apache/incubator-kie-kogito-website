## Deploying Kogito services on OpenShift

As a developer of business processes and decisions, you can deploy Kogito services on OpenShift for cloud implementation.

You can use the Kogito command-line interface (CLI) to interact with the Kogito Operator for deployment tasks.

To help you deploy your services on OpenShift, Kogito provides the following resources:
